# Capstone Project: Educational Programming Hangman Game & Website

Welcome to our Capstone Project for the University of Maryland Global Campus undergraduate degree. This project is a collaborative effort by a team of five students, divided into web development and game design roles, to create an educational platform. This platform includes a responsive website that hosts an interactive Hangman game focused on teaching programming concepts.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to combine education and entertainment, leveraging the appeal of the classic Hangman game to introduce and reinforce programming concepts. The project is split into two main components:
- **The Website:** Designed and built by our front-end development team, it serves as the platform's backbone, offering information about the project and the team and hosting the interactive game.
- **The Game:** Developed by our game design team, it challenges users to guess programming-related words, promoting learning through engagement and interaction.

## Team Composition

- **Web Development Team:** Focuses on designing and creating a responsive and user-friendly website.
- **Game Design Team:** Concentrates on developing the educational Hangman game, incorporating programming concepts into its gameplay.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning Tool:** The Hangman game introduces players to programming terminology in a fun and engaging way.
- **Educational Content:** The game provides an explanation for each word guessed correctly, turning each round into a learning opportunity.
- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to various devices, ensuring accessibility and a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Meet the Team:** The website includes a section dedicated to the team, sharing insights about the members behind the project.
