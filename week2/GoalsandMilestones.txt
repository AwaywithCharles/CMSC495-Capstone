# Week 2 Project Goals and Milestones for The Web Game Devs

This week, our team focused on laying the groundwork for our project. We aim to create a responsive, one-page website featuring an interactive Hangman game centered on programming concepts. Below I broke it down following similar SDLC processes that I have used previously for various projects in the industry, I included an Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document for the web design portion (following IEEEâ€™s template), and Game Development Document (GDD) for the game development, as well as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) sheet.  

## Key Milestones:

1. Requirements and Documentation:
- Finalize and review the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Game Design Document (GDD), incorporating our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) strategy. (Charles leads, with contributions from all members for feedback.)
1. Development Environment Setup:
- Establish the development environment with Godot 4.2 and configure the tools for HTML5 web export. (Charles and Jade)
- Create a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration on the project. (Charles will initialize it, and everyone will clone and set it up in VSCode.)
- Use Trello board for agile project management, defining our workflow and initial tasks. (Start breaking down the weeks for the project to set deadlines and goals.)
1. Initial Game and Website Development:
- Start developing the Hangman game in GDScript, emphasizing core mechanics and the programming-related word database. (Jade/ Charles)
- Begin designing and coding the website's layout, ensuring responsiveness and including placeholders for the game, team information, and other relevant sections. (Robyn, Ada, and Holland focus on website layout design.)
1. Design Considerations:
- Decide on a cohesive color palette for the website and game to ensure a unified look and feel. (Ada leads the design choice, with input from Jade and Robyn.)
1. Team Collaboration and Communication:
- Regularly communicate through Discord to stay updated on progress and hurdles. (Everyone)
- Update the Trello board consistently to reflect the current status of tasks and upcoming priorities. (Everyone)
1. Technical Setup Guide:
- Compile a guide for team members using GitHub with Visual Studio Code for efficient version control and collaboration. (Charles will draft.)

## Specific Requirements and Scenarios:

- The game will actively engage users by challenging them to guess programming-related terms, with hints about their functions in the programming world. Successfully guessing a word triggers a popup explaining the term's significance, adding an educational layer to the game.

## System Specifications:

- Development focuses on Godot 4.2 for game programming and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the website. We advise users to access our product using up-to-date web browsers on devices capable of efficiently running HTML5 content for an optimal experience
